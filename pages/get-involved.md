title: How to get involved

We will incorporate cooperative evaluation throughout the project, conducting iterative and collaborative evaluation with users throughout development.
To do this, we will arrange events such as the User Requirements Gathering meeting (January 2025), related to project milestones. Throughout the project, we will engage with users via Slack, our mailing list, and at the TeSS Club.
