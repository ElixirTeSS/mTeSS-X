<div class="objective"><p>
<span class="objname">Objective <strong><span class="u">m</span>TeSS</strong></span>: 
catalogues are pooled into a shared instance but look to their community as if they have their own catalogue with their own identity.

<p>
A single TeSS instance presents multiple tailored catalogues whose selections of training material are “views”  on a global catalogue. 
Each community registers, maintains and curates their material for their  members in their own virtual space in the common portal environment. 
</p>
<p>
We will show merging of the ELIXIR and PaN-Training portals into one managed instance 
yet presenting these as apparently independent portals with the benefit of shared content.
