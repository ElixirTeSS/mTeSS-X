title: What do we mean by eXchange?
---

**Objective TeSS-X: catalogues are implemented as separate instances and exchange content automatically.**

<div class="row">
<div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
{% include image.html file="graphic-exchange.svg" alt="Graphic of eXchange" class="graphic-objective" %}
</div>
<div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-6">
<p>
If a community runs its own instance then a TeSS-X plugin sets up an exchange  with other instances. 
We will show how several TeSS-instance catalogues exchange nominated  training resources.
</p>
<p>
Mixing and matching these setups we enable cross-disciplinary training knowledge exchange and  optimise portal operation, and serve training providers and consumers.
