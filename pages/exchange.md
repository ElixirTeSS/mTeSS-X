<div class="objective"><p>
<span class="objname">Objective <strong>TeSS-<span class="u">X</span></strong></span>: 
catalogues are implemented as separate instances and exchange content automatically.
</p></div>

If a community runs its own instance then a TeSS-X plugin sets up an exchange  with other instances. 
We will show how several TeSS-instance catalogues exchange nominated  training resources.
</p>
<p>
Mixing and matching these setups we enable cross-disciplinary training knowledge exchange and  optimise portal operation, and serve training providers and consumers.
