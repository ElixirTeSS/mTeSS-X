title: "mTeSS-X: Scaling training portal federation for RIs through Multi-tenanting and Exchange"
---

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
    To overcome fragmentation of training resources across Research Infrastructures (RIs)
    and the Science Clusters, the mTeSS-X project aims to enhance the existing 
    <a href="https://tess.elixir-europe.org/about"> ELIXIR TeSS platform</a> &mdash; 
to build an aggregator for training portals like ELIXIR TeSS and 
    <a href="https://www.panosc.eu/training-catalogue/">PaNOSC training portals</a>
    &mdash; to natively support federation. 
    
    Such a fully-featured open-source multi-tenanted training platform is expected to be an 
    innovation for building a federation of portals to:

    <ul>
      <li> help break down barriers between thematic communities,</li>
      <li> promote a more cohesive European research community, </li>
      <li> and promote FAIR and open training.</li>
     </ul>

</div>

The project strives to support the federation of training catalogues using a multi-tenancy approach, and enabling cross-instance content exchange. 
This will allow RIs and their communities to maintain tailored catalogues with distinct identities, while simultaneously benefiting from a shared global pool of resources.

    <h3>Challenge</h3>
    <p>Fragmentation of resources hampers the reuse of valuable training materials
      and limits the dissemination of events and learning pathways. <br/>
      The main challenges of the project are i) to enable the federation of catalogues,
      ii) support cross-discipline training resource exchange, and iii) celebrate and maintain
      catalogue unique identity. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>mTeSS-X will extend the TeSS platform by introducing multi-tenancy, allowing
     multiple communities to maintain distinct training catalogues within a shared
     instance, while preserving their individual identities. <br />
     It will also implement TeSS-X plugins to facilitate seamless content exchange between
     catalogues implemented as separate instances. </p>

    <h3>Scientific Impact</h3>
    <p>By fostering the federation of interoperable training catalogues, mTeSS-X will
      significantly enhance the findability, accessibility, and reuse of high-quality training
      resources (<a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR principles</a>). </p>
