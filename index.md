title: "mTeSS-X: Scaling training portal federation for RIs through Multi-tenanting and Exchange"
---

With the goal of overcoming the fragmentation of training resources across Research Infrastructures (RIs) and the Science Clusters, the mTeSS-X project will enhance the existing open-source TeSS platform  - developed by ELIXIR specifically for building aggregator training portals, and currently used in ELIXIR and PaNOSC training portals - to natively support federation. Such a fully-featured open-source multi-tenanted training platform is expected to be an innovation for building a federation of portals to help break down barriers between thematic communities, promote a more cohesive European research community, and promote FAIR and open training.

The project strives to support the federation of training catalogues using a multi-tenancy approach, and enabling cross-instance content exchange. This will allow RIs and their communities to maintain tailored catalogues with distinct identities, while simultaneously benefiting from a shared global pool of resources.
