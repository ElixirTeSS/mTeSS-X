title: "mTeSS-X: Scaling training portal federation for RIs through Multi-tenanting and Exchange"
---

<div class="row">
  <div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
    To overcome fragmentation of training resources across Research Infrastructures (RIs)
    and the Science Clusters, the mTeSS-X project will enhance the existing 
    <a href="https://tess.elixir-europe.org/about">TeSS platform</a>. 
    Developed by <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/">ELIXIR</a> specifically 
    for building aggregator training portals, it is currently used in ELIXIR and 
    <a href="https://www.panosc.eu/training-catalogue/">PaNOSC training portals</a> 
    to natively support federation. 
    mTeSS-X goes beyond TeSS purpose and (innovate by gathering || acts like a one-stop-shop by showcasing)
    all training materials found in each independant TeSS instances, 
    enabling cross-instance content exchange.
    This fully-featured open-source multi-tenanted training platform will help break down 
    barriers between thematic communities through the promotion of FAIR 
    and open training and thus leading to a 
    more cohesive European research community.

 This will allow RIs and their communities to maintain tailored catalogues with distinct identities, while simultaneously benefiting from a shared global pool of resources.

    <h3>Challenge</h3>
    <p>Fragmentation of resources hampers the reuse of valuable training materials
      and limits the dissemination of events and learning pathways. <br/>
      The main challenges of the project is to i) enable the federation of catalogues,
      ii) support cross-discipline training resource exchange, and iii) celebrate and maintain
      catalogue unique identity. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-12 col-md-4 col-lg-4">
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>mTeSS-X will extend the TeSS platform by introducing multi-tenancy, allowing
     multiple communities to maintain distinct training catalogues within a shared
     instance, while preserving their individual identities.<br/>
     It will also implement TeSS-X plugins to facilitate seamless content exchange between
     catalogues implemented as separate instances. </p>

    <h3>Scientific Impact</h3>
    <p>By fostering the federation of interoperable training catalogues, mTeSS-X will
      significantly enhance the findability, accessibility, and reuse of high-quality training
      resources (<a href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR principles</a>). </p>
